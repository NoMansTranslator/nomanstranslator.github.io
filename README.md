# No Man’s Translator

A pet project intended to be a helper for players of [No Man’s Sky](https://nomanssky.com).

It Translates to and from English, Gek, Korvax, Vy’keen, and Atlas. The dictionaries have been sourced from the [No Man’s Sky Wiki](https://nomanssky.gamepedia.com).

To use it, simply type in one of the five boxes and the translator will do the rest as you type. If you’re ever left wondering what that character might just have told you, simply copy the dialogue into the appropriate language box and see the translation in the English box.

Enjoy, and thanks for stopping by!
